# Introduction

This vignette will introduce you to colony events. We implemented the most
important natural events like swarming, supersedure, and collapse of the colony,
and a beekeeping management practice called splitting. All functions that
implement colony events work both on `Colony` and `MultiColony` objects.

# Swarming

Swarming is the process in which honeybee colonies reproduce to form new
colonies. When a honeybee colony outgrows its hive, becomes too congested, or
too populated for the queen's pheromones to spread among workers, then the
swarming begins. The workers start building swarm cells for new virgin queens.
When the queen is ready, she leaves the hive and is followed by about 70% of the
workers in a massive cloud of flying bees, the swarm (Rangel et al., 2012). The
swarm will cluster on a nearby tree and the remain there until they find a
suitable new home.

The virgin queens developing in the old hive are daughters of the queen that
swarmed and are attended by the remnant workers that did not leave with the
swarm. After few days, the new virgin queens begin to emerge. Typically, the
first queen to emerge will kill the rest of virgin queens to assume the role as
the new queen for the colony. She will then go on a mating flight to find drones
to mate with to begin laying eggs and rebuilding the workforce in the colony
(Clemson Cooperative Extension, 2021; Rangel et al., 2012)

In the simulation, we first need to initiate a simulation with 10 base virgin
queens. We next create a colony (`Colony` class) and an apiary (`MultiColony`
class).

```{r create founder genoms and a Colony and Multicolony objects }
founderGenomes <- quickHaplo(nInd = 30, nChr = 1, segSites = 100)
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)
drones <- createDrones(basePop[1], n = 1000)
fatherGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(drones, n = 30, nDrones = 10)

# Create Colony and MultiColony class
colony <- createColony(x = basePop[2])
colony <- cross(colony, drones = fatherGroups[[1]])
colony <- buildUp(colony, nWorkers = 100, nDrones = 20)

apiary <- createMultiColony(basePop[3:8], n = 6)
apiary <- cross(apiary, drones = fatherGroups[2:7])
apiary <- buildUp(apiary, nWorkers = 100, nDrones = 20, exact = TRUE)
```

In SIMplyBee, we developed a function `swarm()` that simulates swarming. The
function takes a `Colony` class object and a percentage `p` of workers that
leave with the swarm. The function returns is a list with two `Colony` class
objects, `swarm` and `remnant`. The `swarm` contains the old queen and `p`
percentage of workers that left the hive. The `remnant` contains the rest of
workers `(1-p)`, all the drones, and virgin queens that are daughters of the old
queen that swarmed.

Let's swarm our `colony`. Since the output of a function is a list with
colonies, we must save it in a new (temporary) object.

```{r swarm colony }
tmp <- swarm(colony, p = 0.4)
tmp
```

The function returns two colonies: `remnant` and `swarm`. The `remnant` colony
does not have a queen but has one virgin queen that must be mated. It also has
60 workers since we set `p` argument to 0.4, meaning that 40% of workers will
leave with the swarm. All the drones remained in the `remnant` and that `swarm`
is turned to `TRUE`.

The `swarm` contains the old queen, no virgin queens, and 40 workers, since we
set the proportion `p` to 0.4. Same as in the `remnant`, the `swarm` status is
turned to `TRUE` in the `swarm`.

Swarming also turns the `production` slot to FALSE for both, the `swarm` and the
`remnant` colony, since in reality, you would not be able to collect honey from
such colonies (or other products).

The `swarm` stays genetically identical to the "old" colony, although downsized.
Hence, we assign the `swarm` back to the original colony. The `remnant` has a
new queen is hence genetically different from the original colony. Thus, we
considered it to be a new colony.

```{r saving output of the function}
colony <- tmp$swarm
colony1 <- tmp$remnant
colony <- buildUp(colony)
```

After swarming, the colony would usually build-up back to the full size and the
virgin queens would mate. Building-up a colony turns the `production` status
back to `TRUE`, since we assume, the colonies are at their full-size.

Instead of setting the `p` everytime we call the `swarm()` function, we can save
the `swarmP` argument in the `SimParamBee` object. The `swarm()` function will
then use this percentage if `p` is not set.

```{r inspect the p swarm parameter in SP object}
SP$swarmP
```

The default value is 0.5, but we can set any value we want.

```{r set our own swarmP in SP object}
SP$swarmP <- 0.35
SP$swarmP
```

We swarm a `MultiColony` object is the same was we swarm a single `Colony` -
with the `swarm()` function. The `swarm()` function is here applied to each
colony in the `MultiColony()` object with the same parameters. The function now
returns two `MultiColony()` objects - one containing the `swarms` and the other
containing the `remnants`.

```{r swarming MultyColony}
tmp <- swarm(apiary)
tmp
```

We see that we get six swarms and six remnants from the apiary with six
colonies. We can inspect individuals colonies to ensure they swarmed according
to the parameters. Let's inspect the `swarm` and `remnant` of the third colony.

```{r inspect the output (swarm)}
tmp$swarm[[3]]
```

```{r inspect the output (remnant)}
tmp$remnant[[3]]
```

We see that the the third colony was swarmed with `p` of 35% as specified in the
`SimParamBee`, hence the swarm left with 35 workers and the old queen, and the
remnant stayed behind with a new virgin queen and 65 workers.

Above, all the colonies in a `MultiColony` are swarmed with the same percentage.
However, we can also specify a different `p` for each colony.

```{r swarmed MultyColony object with different swarm p}
tmp <- swarm(apiary, p = c(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8))
```

If we now inspect the first and the second swarm, we see that each colony has a
different percentage of workers that stayed or left.

If you want to track the genetics, you would assign the swarms back to the
original apiary and create a new apiary from the remnant. However, if you want
to track the position, the remnant actually stay in the same position and would
hence be assigned back to the same apiary, while the swarm would be assigned to
a new apiary or be lost.

You can also use a non-fixed `p` parameter by using the function `swarmPUnif`
that samples the `p` from a uniform distribution between values 0.4 and 0.6
irrespective of the colony strength.

```{r assign swarm back to apiary and build up the apiary}
apiary <- tmp$swarm
apiary <- buildUp(apiary)
```

# Split

Colony splitting is a common beekeeping technique for managing swarming. A
percentage of workers, brood, and food stores are removed and combined in a new
colony. Old queen normally stays with split colony (remnant in our function). We
created a function `split()` that works on `Colony` and `Multicolony` objects.
Argument `p` is proportion of workers that will go to new colony. The output of
the function is a list of two `Colony` or `MultiColony` objects. The `split()`
function follows the same principles as the `swarm()`, hence we will spent less
time explaining the outputs.

```{r split a colony}
tmp <- split(colony, p = 0.3)
colony <- tmp$remnant
colony
```

We see that remnant contains the old queen (ID 2), and 70% of workers since we
set `p` argument to 0.3, meaning that 30% of workers are removed in the split.
The `split` status of the `remnant` colony is turned to `TRUE`. The `production`
status of the `remnant` stays `TRUE`, because in reality we always split a
colony in a way that does not threaten the production of the remnant colony.

After a split, the colony would build-up back to their full-size.

```{r build up the colony}
colony <- buildUp(colony)
```

If we inspect the `split`, we see that it contains 30% of the workers, the
`split` status is turned to `TRUE`, and the `production` status is turned to
`FALSE`, since in reality, these small colonies would not be productive.

```{r inspect the split}
tmp$split
```

The `p` argument for splitting can be also saved in `SP` object, so we do not
specify it each time we call the function. We call `SimParamBee$splitP` and
assign new `p` argument in the `SP` object.

We split a `MultiColony` object in the same way we split a `Colony` (as shown in
swarm).

```{r split the MultiColony object and inspect the first colony in remnant}
tmp <- split(apiary, p = 0.3)
tmp$remnant[[1]]
```

We again see that in remnant we have mated queen and 70 workers...

```{r inspect the split of the first colony}
tmp$split[[1]]
```

and a virgin queen with 30 workers in split. We can use the vector of `p`,
different for each colony same as in `swarm()` function.

After the split, we would assign the remnant colonies back to the apiary and
build them up.

```{r build up the colony and apaiary for further examples}
apiary <- tmp$remnant
apiary <- buildUp(apiary)
```

# Supersedure

Supersedure is a replacement of a queen by her daughter without interference of
beekeeper. Supersedure is a natural way of requeening without swarming. There
are many reasons for supersedure: poor physical condition of a queen, old age,
diseases, depleted spermatheca, poorly bread queen, reduced pheromone output and
many others (Hamdan, 2010).

```{r inspect the colony}
colony
```

SIMplyBee contains a function `supersede()` that removes the old queen and
triggers the creation of new virgin queens from the brood. The function returns
a single `Colony` or `MultiColony` object (not a list of two).

```{r supersede Colony object}
colony <- supersede(colony)
colony
```

We see that after a supersedure, the old queen is removed and a new virgin queen
is ready to mate. Hence, the next step in the simulation would be to cross this
virgin queen. We also see that the `supersedure` status is set to `TRUE`. The
`production` status stay set to `TRUE`, since the colony did not loose any
individuals (stayed at it's full-size).

The function `supersede()` works both on `Colony` and `MultiColony` classes. We
supersede a `MultiColony` in a same way as a `Colony`.

```{r supersede Multicolony object}
apiary <- supersede(apiary)
apiary
```

# Collapse

Collapse of the colony is a term that describes the death of a colony. All
individuals within a colony die when collapse occurs. There are many reasons for
the collapse of a honey bee colony: diseases, starvation, queen problems, and
environmental and in-hive contamination with pesticides. Colony losses can be
very high, up to 60% of colonies per year. High colony losses can significantly
influence genetic structure of a population and genetic gain.

Let's again create a fresh colony and an apiary.

```{r create the colony and Mlticolony }
colony <- createColony(x = basePop[20])
colony <- cross(colony, drones = fatherGroups[[20]])
colony <- buildUp(colony, nWorkers = 100, nDrones = 20)

apiary <- createMultiColony(basePop[21:26], n = 6)
apiary <- cross(apiary, drones = fatherGroups[21:26])
apiary <- buildUp(apiary, nWorkers = 100, nDrones = 20, exact = TRUE)
```

SIMplyBee includes a function `collapse()` that simulates the collapse of a
colony. This function does not remove individuals from the colony, but sets the
`collapse()` status of the colony to `TRUE` and `production` status to `FALSE`.
In reality, bees would still be present in the colony, although dead. This
allows us to extract any genetic material from the colony even after collapse.
However, future operations in terms of reproduction or simulation of events are
not allowed with a collapsed colony.

```{r collapse the colony}
colony <- collapse(colony)
colony
```

The function works also `MultiColony` objects. `collapse()` function is used
when you want to keep collapsed colonies for subsequent genetic analysis. In
case when you don't need the collapsed colony, you can simply select the
survivors with `selectColonies()` function.

```{r collapse the MultiColony}
apiary <- collapse(apiary)
apiary[[3]]
apiary
```
