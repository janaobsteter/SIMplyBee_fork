# Introduction

This vignette describes and demonstrates how SIMplyBee implements quantitative
genetics principles for honeybees. Specifically, it describes three different
examples where we simulate:

  1. Honey yield - a single colony trait,
  
  2. Honey yield and Calmness - two colony traits, and
  
  3. Colony strength and Honey yield - two colony traits where one trait impacts
     the other one via the number of workers.

We start by loading SIMplyBee and quickly simulating genomes for some founder
honeybees. Specifically, genomes for 20 individuals with 16 chromosomes and 1000
segregating sites per chromosome.

```{r founderGenomes}
library(package = "SIMplyBee")
library(package = "ggplot2")
founderGenomes <- quickHaplo(nInd = 20, nChr = 16, segSites = 1000)
```

# Honey yield

This section shows how to simulate one colony trait, honey yield, that is
influenced by the queen and workers as well as the environment. We will achieve
this by:

  a. Setting base population quantitative genetic parameters,
  b. Inspecting values in the base population,
  c. Inspecting values in a colony,
  d. Calculating Colony value,
  e. Calculating MultiColony values, and 
  f. Selection on colony values.

## Base population quantitative genetic parameters

AlphaSimR, and hence SIMplyBee, simulates each individual with its corresponding
genome and quantitative genetic and phenotypic values. To enable this simulation,
we must set base population quantitative genetic parameters for the traits of
interest in the global simulation parameters via `SimParamBee`. We must set:

  1) the number of traits,
  2) the number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect the traits,
  3) the distribution of QTL effects,
  4) trait means, and
  5) trait genetic and environmental variances - if we simulate multiple traits,
     we must also specify genetic and environmental covariances between the
     traits.

In honeybees, the majority of traits are influenced by the queen and workers. 
There are many biological mechanisms for these queen and workers effects.
Depending on which caste is the main driver of the trait (the queen or workers),
we also talk about direct and indirect effects. For example, for honey yield,
workers directly affect honey yield by foraging, while the queen indirectly
affects honey yield by stimulating workers via pheromone production. The queen
and workers effects for a trait can be genetically and environmentally independent
or correlated (negatively or positively). 

Here, we will simulate two traits to represent the queen and workers effects on
honey yield. From this point onward we will use the terms the queen effect and
queen trait interchangeably. The same applies to workers effect and workers
trait. These two effects (=traits) will give rise to honey yield trait. We will
assume that colony honey yield is approximately normally distributed with the
mean of 20 kg and variance of 4 $kg^2$, which implies that most colonies will
have honey yield between 14 kg and 26 kg (see
`hist(rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 20, sd = sqrt(4)))`). Traits like honey yield have
a complex polygenic genetic architecture, so we will assume that this trait is
influenced by 100 QTL per chromosome (with 16 chromosomes, this gives us 1600
QTL in total).

We will first initiate global simulation parameters and set the mean of queen
effects to 10 kg with genetic variance of 1 $kg^2$, while we will set the mean
of workers effects to 10 kg with genetic variance of 1 $kg^2$, both proportionally
scaled by the expected number of workers in a colony. The mean and variance for
the queen effect is assumed larger than for the workers effect, because there is
one queen and many workers in colony and we assume that workers effects
"accumulate". Deciding how to split the colony mean between queen and workers
effects will depend on the individual to colony mapping function, whici we will
describe in the Colony value sub-section.

```{r SimParamBee_mean_and_varA}
# Global simulation parameters
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)

nQtlPerChr <- 100

# Genetic parameters for queen and workers effects - each represented by a trait
mean <- c(10, 10 / SP$nWorkers)
varA <- c(1, 1 / SP$nWorkers)
```

We next set genetic correlation between the queen and workers effects to -0.5 to
reflect the commonly observed antagonistic relationship between these effects.
With all the quantitative genetic parameters defined, we now add two additive
traits to global simulation parameters and name them `queenTrait` and `workerTrait`.
These parameters drive the simulation of QTL effects. Read about all the other
trait simulation options in AlphaSimR via: `vignette(topic = "traits", package="AlphaSimR")`.

```{r SimParamBee_corA_and_addTrait}
corA <- matrix(data = c( 1.0, -0.5, 
                        -0.5,  1.0), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
SP$addTraitA(nQtlPerChr = nQtlPerChr, mean = mean, var = varA, corA = corA,
             name = c("queenTrait", "workersTrait"))
```

Finally, we set the environmental variance of the queen and workers effects to
3 $kg^2$ and we again scale the worker variance by the expected number of workers.
Contrary to the negative genetic correlation, we here assume that environmental
correlation between the queen and workers effects is slightly positive, 0.3. This
is just an example! These parameters should be based on literature or simulation
scenarios of interest.

```{r SimParamBee_varE_and_corR}
varE <- c(3, 3 / SP$nWorkers)
corE <- matrix(data = c(1.0, 0.3, 
                        0.3, 1.0), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
SP$setVarE(varE = varE, corE = corE)
```

## Values in the base population

Now we create a base population of virgin queens. Since we defined two traits,
all honeybees in the simulation will have genetic and phenotypic values for both
traits. The genetic values are stored in the `gv` slot of each `Pop` object,
while phenotypic values are  stored in the `pheno` slot.

```{r basePop_virgin_queens}
# Base population virgin queens
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes, n = 20)
head(basePop@gv)
head(basePop@pheno)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
limQ <- range(c(basePop@gv[, "queenTrait"], basePop@pheno[, "queenTrait"]))
brkQ <- seq(from = limQ[1], to = limQ[2], length.out = 10)
limW <- range(c(basePop@gv[, "workersTrait"], basePop@pheno[, "workersTrait"]))
brkW <- seq(from = limW[1], to = limW[2], length.out = 10)
hist(basePop@gv[, "queenTrait"], xlab = "Genetic value", main = "Queen effect", xlim = limQ, breaks = brkQ)
hist(basePop@gv[, "workersTrait"], xlab = "Genetic value", main = "Workers effect", xlim = limW, breaks = brkW)
hist(basePop@pheno[, "queenTrait"], xlab = "Phenotypic value", main = "Queen effect", xlim = limQ, breaks = brkQ)
hist(basePop@pheno[, "workersTrait"], xlab = "Phenotypic value", main = "Workers effect", xlim = limW, breaks = brkW)
```

Note that these are virgin queens, yet we obtained queen and workers effect
values for them! Is this wrong? No! Virgin queens carry DNA with genes that are
differentially expressed in different castes, which would be only showed in their
phenotype. Hence, virgin queens have genetic values for the queen and worker
effects, but they might never actually express these effects. In this simulation
virgin queens also obtained phenotypic values for both of the effects. This is
technically incorrect because virgin queens don't express genes for the worker
effect at all, and they also do not express the queen effect, not until they
become the queen of a colony. We can treat these phenotypic values for virgin
queens as values that we could see if these virgin queens would express these
traits. We will show later in the Colony value sub-section how we use these
traits from different castes. If existence of these phenotypic values for certain
castes is a hindrance, we can always remove them for population or colony objects
by modifying the corresponding slots as required.

As with the virgin queens, drones also carry DNA with genes that are expressed
in different castes. Therefore, drones will also have the queen and workers effect
genetic (and phenotypic values) for honey yield even though they do not contribute
to this trait in a colony.

```{r basePop_drones}
# Base population drones
drones <- createDrones(x = basePop[1:5], nInd = 3)
head(drones@gv)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(drones@gv[, "queenTrait"], xlab = "Genetic value", main = "Queen effect")
hist(drones@gv[, "workersTrait"], xlab = "Genetic value", main = "Workers effect")
```

## Values in a colony

We continue by creating a colony from one base population virgin queen, crossing
it, and adding some workers.

```{r create_colony}
colony <- createColony(x = basePop[6])
colony <- cross(x = colony, drones = drones)
colony <- addWorkers(x = colony, nInd = 50)
colony
```

We can access the genetic and phenotypic values of colony members with functions
`getGv()` and `getPheno()`, both of which have the `caste` argument (see more
via `help(getGv)`).

```{r getGv_and_getPheno}
getGv(colony, caste = "queen")
getGv(colony, caste = "workers") |> head(n = 4)

getPheno(colony, caste = "queen")
getPheno(colony, caste = "workers") |> head(n = 4)
```

For convenience, there are also alias functions for accessing the genetic and
phenotypic values of each caste directly.

```{r getGv_and_getPheno_caste}
getQueenGv(colony)
getWorkersGv(colony) |> head(n = 4)

getQueenPheno(colony)
getWorkersPheno(colony) |> head(n = 4)
```

Some phenotypes, such as honey yield, are only expressed if colony is at its
full-size. This is achieved by the `buildUp()` colony event function that adds
worker and drones and hence turns on the `production` status of the colony (to
`TRUE`). SIMplyBee includes a function `ìsProductive()` to check the production
status of a colony.

```{r build_up_colony}
# Check if colony is productive
isProductive(colony)

# Build-up the colony and check the production status again
colony <- buildUp(colony)
colony
isProductive(colony)
```

For the ease of further demonstration, we now combine workers' values into a single data.frame.

```{r data.frame}
# Collate genetic and phenotypic values of workers
df <- data.frame(id = colony@workers@id,
                 mother = colony@workers@mother,
                 father = colony@workers@father,
                 gvQueenTrait = colony@workers@gv[, "queenTrait"],
                 gvWorkersTrait = colony@workers@gv[, "workersTrait"],
                 pvQueenTrait =  colony@workers@pheno[, "queenTrait"],
                 pvWorkersTrait = colony@workers@pheno[, "workersTrait"])
head(df)
```

To visualise correlation between queen and workers effects in workers, we plot
these effect values against each other.

```{r plot_queen_vs_worker_values}
# Covariation between queen and workers effect genetic values in workers
p <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = gvQueenTrait, y = gvWorkersTrait)) +
  xlab("Genetic value for the queen effect") +
  ylab("Genetic value for the workers effect") +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
print(p)
```

In SIMplyBee, we know genetic values of all individuals, including drones that
the queen mated with (=fathers in a colony)!

```{r fathers_values}
# Variation in patriline genetic values
getFathersGv(colony)
```

Knowing father of each worker, we inspect variation in the distribution of genetic
values of worker by the patriline (workers from a single father drone) for the
workers effect.

```{r distribution_by_patriline}
# Variation in workers effect genetic values by patriline in workers
p <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = gvWorkersTrait, colour = father)) +
  xlab("Genetic value for the workers effect") +
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic()
print(p)
```

## Colony value
 
However, in honeybees we usually don't observe values on individuals, but on a
colony. SIMplyBee provides functions for mapping individual values to a colony
value. The general function for this is `calcColonyValue()`, which can combine
any value and trait from any caste. There are also aliases `calcColonyGv()` and
`calcColonyPheno()`. These functions require users to specify the so-called
mapping function (via the `FUN` argument). The mapping function specifies queen
and workers traits (potentially also drone traits) and what function we want to
apply to each of them before mapping them to the colony value(s). We can also
specify, whether the colony value(s) depend on the production status. For example,
if a colony is not productive, its honey yield would be 0 or unobserved.
SIMplyBee provides a general mapping function `mapCasteToColonyValue()`
and aliases `mapCasteToColonyGv()` and `mapCasteToColonyPheno()`. These functions
have arguments to cater for various situations By default, they first calculate
caste values: leave the queen's value as it is, sum workers' values, potentially
sum drones' values, and lastly sum all these caste values together into a colony
value (Figure XXX). Users can provide their own mapping function(s) too!

TODO: DAG - figure from Laura

We now calculate honey yield for our colony - a single value for the colony.

```{r colony_pheno}
# Colony phenotype value
calcColonyPheno(colony, queenTrait = "queenTrait", workersTrait = "workersTrait")
help(calcColonyPheno)
help(mapCasteToColonyPheno)
```

These colony values are not stored in a colony, because they change as colony
changes due to various events. For example, reducing the number of workers will
reduce the colony honey yield.

```{r colony_pheno_change}
# Colony phenotype value from a reduced colony
removeWorkers(colony, p = 0.5) |>
  calcColonyPheno(queenTrait = "queenTrait", workersTrait = "workersTrait")
```

Please note that we assumed that the queen contributes half to colony honey
yield and workers contribute the other half. This means that removing workers
will still give a non-zero honey yield! This shows that we have to design
the mapping between individual, caste, and colony values with care!

```{r colony_pheno_change}
# Colony phenotype value from a reduced colony
removeWorkers(colony, p = 0.99) |>
  calcColonyPheno(queenTrait = "queenTrait", workersTrait = "workersTrait")
```
 
Finally, note that SIMplyBee currently does not provide functionaly for breeding
values, dominance deviations, and epistatic deviations at caste and colony levels,
despite the availabiliy of AlphaSimR `bv()`, `dd()`, and `aa()` functions. This
is so, because we have to check or develop theory on how to calculate these
values across active colonies and hence we currently advise against the use of
AlphaSimR `bv()`, `dd()`, and `aa()` functions with SIMplyBee as the output of
these functions could be easily misinterpreted.

## MultiColony values

The same functions can be used on a `MultiColony` class object. Let's create an apiary.

```{r multicolony}
apiary <- createMultiColony(basePop[7:20])
drones <- createDrones(basePop[1:5], nInd = 100)
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(drones, n = nColonies(apiary), nDrones = 15)
apiary <- cross(apiary, droneGroups)
apiary <- buildUp(apiary)
```

We can extract the genetic and phenotypic values from multiple colonies in the
same manner as from a single colony, by using `get*Gv()` and `get*Pheno()` functions.
The output of these function is a named list with values for each colony or a
data.frame if we set the `collapse` argument to `TRUE`.

```{r multicolony_gv}
getQueenGv(apiary) |> head(n = 4)
getQueenGv(apiary, collapse = TRUE) |> head(n = 4)
```

In a similar manner, we can calculate colony value for all the colonies in our
apiary, where the row names of the output represent colony IDs.

```{r multicolony_pheno}
colonyGv <- calcColonyGv(apiary))
colonyPheno <- calcColonyPheno(apiary))
data.frame(colonyGv, colonyPheno)
```

## Selection on colony values

Since the aim of selection is to select the best individuals or colonies for the reproduction, we could select the best colony in our apiary based on either genetic or phenotypic value for grafting the new generation of queens. The colony with the highest genetic value is colony with ID 6, hence we select it for further reproduction.

TODO: improve this code once selectColonies() is improved

```{r multicolony_selection}
(bestColonyId <- names(colonyValuesGv[order(colonyValuesGv[, 1], decreasing = TRUE), ])[1])
apiary[[bestColonyId]]
# selectColonies(apiary, ID = bestColonyId)
```

# Honey yield and Calmness

In this section we expand simulation to two uncorrelated colony traits with
queen and workers effects, honey yield and calmness. We follow the same recipe
as in the previous section where we simulated only one colony trait.

We first reinitialize the global simulation parameters because we will define
new traits. For honey yield we will use the same parameters as before, while for
calmness trait we will assume that the trait is scored continuously in such a
way that negative values are undesirable and positive values are desirable with
zero being population mean. We will further assume the same variances for calmness
as for honey yield, and a genetic (and environmental) correlation between the
queen and workers effects of -0.4 (and 0.2) for calmness. We assume no genetic
or environmental correlation between honey yield and calmness. Beware, this is
just an example to show you how to simulate multiple colony traits - we have
made up these parameters - please use literature estimates in your simulations!

```{r SimParamBee_2}
# Global simulation parameters
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)

nQtlPerChr <- 100

# Quantitative genetic parameters - for two traits, each with the queen and workers effects
meanP <- c(10, 10 / SP$nWorkers, 0, 0)
varA <- c(1, 1 / SP$nWorkers, 1, 1 / SP$nWorkers)
corA <- matrix(data = c( 1.0, -0.5,  0.0,  0.0, 
                        -0.5,  1.0,  0.0,  0.0,
                         0.0,  0.0,  1.0, -0.4, 
                         0.0,  0.0, -0.4,  1.0), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
SP$addTraitA(nQtlPerChr = 100, mean = meanP, var = varA, corA = corA,
             name = c("yieldQueenTrait", "yieldWorkersTrait",
                      "calmQueenTrait", "calmWorkersTrait"))

varE <- c(3, 3 / SP$nWorkers, 3, 3 / SP$nWorkers)
corE <- matrix(data = c(1.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0,
                        0.3, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                        0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.2,
                        0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
SP$setVarE(varE = varE, corE = corE)
```

We continue by creating a base population of virgin queens and from them an
apiary with 10 full-sized colonies.

```{r base_pop_and_colony}
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)
drones <- createDrones(x = basePop[1:5], nInd = 100)
apiary <- createMultiColony(basePop[6:15])
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(drones, nColonies(apiary), nDrones = 20)
apiary <- cross(x = apiary, drones = droneGroups)
apiary <- buildUp(apiary)
apiary
```

We can again inspect the genetic (and phenotypic) values of all individuals in
each colony and whole apiary with `get*Gv()` and `get*Pheno()` functions. Now,
the output contains four traits representing the queen and workers effect for
honey yield and calmness. These functions also take an `nInd` argument to sample
a number of individuals along with their values.

```{r}
getQueenGv(apiary) |> head(n = 4)
getWorkersPheno(apiary, nInd = 3) |> head(n = 4)
```

Now, we calculate colony genetic and phenotypic values for all colonies in the
apiary. Since we are simulating two traits, honey yield and calmness, we have
two ways to calculate corresponding colony values. The first way is to use the
default `mapCasteToColony*()` function in `calcColony*()` and only define
additional arguments as shown here:

```{r colony_pheno_2a}
colonyValues <- calcColonyPheno(apiary,
                                queenTrait = c("yieldQueenTrait", "calmQueenTrait"),
                                workersTrait = c("yieldWorkersTrait", "calmWorkersTrait"),
                                traitName = c("yield", "calmness"),
                                checkProduction = c(TRUE, FALSE)) |> as.data.frame()
colonyValues
```

The second way is to create our own mapping function. An equivalent outcome to
the above is shown below just to demonstrate use of your own function, but we are
simply just reusing `mapCasteToColonyPheno()` twice;)

```{r colony_pheno_2a}
myMapCasteToColonyPheno <- function(colony) {
  yield <- mapCasteToColonyPheno(colony,
                                 queenTrait = "yieldQueenTrait",
                                 workersTrait = "yieldWorkersTrait",
                                 traitName = "yield",
                                 checkProduction = TRUE)
  calmness <- mapCasteToColonyPheno(colony,
                                    queenTrait = "calmQueenTrait",
                                    workersTrait = "calmWorkersTrait",
                                    traitName = "calmness",
                                    checkProduction = FALSE)
  return(cbind(yield, calmness))
}
colonyValues <- calcColonyPheno(apiary, FUN = myMapCasteToColonyPheno) |> as.data.frame()
colonyValues
```

Again, we can now select the best colony based on the best phenotypic value for
either yield, calmness, or an index of both. Let's say that both traits are
equally important so we select on a weighted sum of both of them - we will use
the AlphaSimR `selIndex()` function that enables this calculation along with scaling.
We will represent the index such that it has a mean of 100 and standard deviation
of 10 units.

```{r}
colonyValues$Index <- selIndex(Y = colonyValues, b = c(0.5, 0.5), scale = TRUE) * 10 + 100
colonyValues[order(colonyValues$Index, decreasing = TRUE), ]
```

We see that based on which selection criteria we use (yield, calmness, or index)
we would be selecting different colonies.

# Strength and honey yield

This section is comprised of the following sub-sections:

TODO
  a. Quantitative genetic parameters,
  b. Values in the base population,
  c. Values in a colony,
  d. Colony value, and
  e. MultiColony values.
  
Now, let's simulate two traits where the phenotype of the first one affects the phenotype of the second one. Here we will show how to use `nWorkers` function to genetically and environmentally influence the colony strength and with this honey yield.

TODO: describe which trait is which (nWorkersColonyPhenotype has queenTrait = 1!)

TODO: say more and show some equations

say that this is just an example assuming that workers don't contribute to how many eggs a queen lays phenotypically!

We follow the same logic as above and simulate two traits again - one representing queen's fecundity, that is colony strength, and the other one representing honey yield. The idea is that the higher the fecundity, the more honey yield due to a larger number of workers. We assume that fecundity is only controled by the queen (and not the workers), hence we simulate only queen effect for it. We again assume that honey yield is affected by the workers and how hard they work as well as how well the queen managed the hive, hence we simulate the queen and the workers effect for it.

```{r SimParamBee_3}
# Global simulation parameters
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)

# Quantitative genetic parameters
# - the first trait has only the queen effect
# - the second trait has both queen and workers effects
mean <- c(100, 20, 0)
# TODO: revise covariances (I made them up!)
varA <- c(100, 1, 1 / mean[1]) # mean[1] will be average nWorkers
corA <- matrix(data = c(1.0,  0.0,  0.0,
                        0.0,  1.0, -0.5, 
                        0.0, -0.5,  1.0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
SP$addTraitA(nQtlPerChr = 100, mean = mean, var = varA, corA = corA,
             name = c("fecundityQueenTrait", "yieldQueenTrait", "yieldWorkersTrait"))

# TODO: revise covariances (I made them up!)
varE <- c(300, 3, 3 / SP$nWorkers)
corE <- matrix(data = c(1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                        0.0, 1.0, 0.3,
                        0.0, 0.3, 1.0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
SP$setVarE(varE = varE, corE = corE)
```

We continue by creating an apiary with 10 full-size colonies.

```{r base_pop_and_colony_2}
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)
drones <- createDrones(x = basePop[1:5], nInd = 100)
apiary <- createMultiColony(basePop[6:15])
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(drones, nColonies(apiary), nDrones = 20)
apiary <- cross(x = apiary, drones = droneGroups)
```

We next build-up the colonies in the apiary. But instead of building them all up to the same fixed numbers of workers and drones, we build them up according to queen's fecundity. For that we use the sampling function `nWorkersColonyPhenotype`, that computes the number of workers based on the simulated `fecundityQueenTrait`. Each colony hence contains a different number of workers. 

```{r colony_strength}
apiary <- buildUp(apiary, nWorkers = nWorkersColonyPhenotype,
                  queenTrait = "fecundityQueenTrait")
nWorkers(apiary)
help(nWorkersColonyPhenotype)
```

To compute the colony value for the yield, we again employ the `calcColonyValue()` function. Here, we compute the phenotype of the colonies in the apiary with `calcColonyPheno()` function.

```{r colony_pheno_3}
calcMyColonyPheno <- function(colony) {
  yield <- mapCasteToColonyPheno(colony,
                                 queenTrait = "yieldQueenTrait",
                                 workersTrait = "yieldWorkersTrait")
  return(matrix(yield))
}
colonyValuesPheno <- calcColonyPheno(apiary, FUN = calcMyColonyPheno)
colonyValuesPheno
```

We again see that the colony with the best phenotype is colony with ID 9 and we would want to select it for further reproduction, let's say a 1000 new virgin queens.

```{r}
bestColony <- selectColonies(apiary, ID = 9)
newQueens <- createVirginQueens(bestColony, nInd = 1000)
```
