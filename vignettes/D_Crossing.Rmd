# Introduction

This vignette shows how you can cross virgin queens in SIMplyBee. Here, we
present how you can cross:

-   single or multiple virgin queens (class `Pop`), virgin queen in a colony
    (class `Colony`), or all the virgin queens in an apiary or population (class
    `MultiColony`);
-   cross either with pre-selected population/group of drones or according to a
    cross plan,
-   cross queens on an open DCA or mating station.

We again load the package, if we haven't already.

```{r}
library(package = "SIMplyBee")
```

First, we have to create a founder population and some virgin queen, virgin
colonies, and virgin apiaries that we will later cross.

```{r}
# Simulate 40 founder genomes
founderGenomes <- quickHaplo(nInd = 50, nChr = 1, segSites = 100)
# Set global population paramaters
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)
# Create a base population of 40 virgin queens
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)

# Prepare populations with a single virgin queen
virginQueen1 <- basePop[1]
virginQueen2 <- basePop[2]
virginQueen3 <- basePop[3]
# Prepare populations with multiple virgin queens
virginQueens1 <- basePop[4:6]
virginQueens2 <- basePop[7:9]
virginQueens3 <- basePop[10:12]
# Prepare virgin Colony objects
colony1 <- createColony(basePop[13])
colony2 <- createColony(basePop[14])
colony3 <- createColony(basePop[15])
colony4 <- createColony(basePop[16])
# Prepare virgin MultiColony objects
apiary1 <- createMultiColony(basePop[17:21])
apiary2 <- createMultiColony(basePop[22:26])
apiary3 <- createMultiColony(basePop[27:31])
apiary4 <- createMultiColony(basePop[32:41])
```

We will now create a groups of drones from the remaining queens with 1000 drones
per queen that will represent a drone congregation area (DCA).

```{r}
# Create a DCA from the remaining virgin queens
DCA <- createDrones(basePop[42:50], nInd = 1000)
```

# Cross virgin queens on an open DCA

## Cross by pre-selecting drone populations

We will start by crossing our populations and colonies to a pre-selected
populations of drones. We pre-select the groups by pulling a desired number of
drone packages from a DCA with the function `pullDroneGroupsFromDCA()`. This
functions requires you to specify a group of drones (`DCA`), how many groups you
want to pull from the DCA (`n`), and how many drones per group you want
(`nDrones`). For `nDrones`, you can either specify an integer or a sampling
function, which results in a different number of drones in each of the pulled
groups (you can read more about this in the Sampling functions vignette). We
provide some suggestions of the sampling functions:

-   nFathersPoisson: samples the number of drones from a Poisson distribution
    with a default mean of 15 (the user can specify a different mean),
-   nFathersTruncatedPoisson: samples the number of drones from a Poisson
    distribution with a default mean of 15 (the user can specif a different
    mean),
-   you can specify your own sampling function.

We can pull the drone groups out separately for each crossing or pull them out
all at once.

```{r}
# Pre-select drone (father) populations from a DCA
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(DCA, n = 20, nDrones = nFathersTruncPoisson)
```

If we inspect these drone groups, we see there is a different number of drones
in each group since we used a sampling function-

```{r}
sapply(droneGroups, FUN = nInd)
```

Now, we can cross our virgin queens to drone groups.

```{r}
# A single virgin queen
virginQueen1 <- cross(virginQueen1, drones = droneGroups[[1]])
nFathers(virginQueen1)
```

```{r}
# Multiple virgin queens
virginQueens1 <- cross(virginQueens1, drones = droneGroups[2:4])
nFathers(virginQueens1)
```

```{r}
# A colony
colony1 <- cross(colony1, drones = droneGroups[[5]])
nFathers(colony1)
```

```{r}
# An apiary
apiary1 <- cross(x = apiary1, drones = droneGroups[6:10])
nFathers(apiary1)
```

## Cross by preparing a cross plan

Providing groups / populations of drones can be memory consuming, especially
when dealing with a large number of colonies. An alternative is to provide a
cross plan with IDs of the virgin queens/colonies and drones, and a single drone
population with all the drones listed in the cross plan. You can create a cross
plan with the function `createRandomCrossPlan()`. This function creates a cross
plan by randomly sampling a desired number of drone IDs from a DCA and assigning
them to either virgin queen ID or colony ID. When crossing a virgin queen in a
colony, you have to provide the colony ID, since there could be multiple virgin
queens within the colony and the random selection of one happens only within the
`cross()` function. To create a cross plan you therefore have to provide the IDs
of either the virgin queens or the colonies you want to cross (but not both in
the same cross plan!!!), the drone population, and the number of drones you want
to cross to a particular virgin queen. This can again be a fixed number or a
sampling function. We can create a separate cross plan for each mating or create
one combined cross plan for multiple matings (but can not have virgin queen's
and colonies's ID in the cross plan at the same time!!!). Here, we again mate a
single virgin queen, a population of virgin queens, a colony, and an apiary.

```{r}
# Create a combined cross for matingn a single queen (virginQueen2) and a population
# of virgin queen (virginQueens2)
(crossPlanQueens <- createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = c(getId(virginQueen2),
                                                 getId(virginQueens2)),
                                         drones = DCA,
                                         nDrones = 15))
```

We see that the created cross plan is a list with IDs corresponding to the
virgin queen's IDs and the elements of each list being the IDs of the drones the
virgin queen will mate with. Now we can cross these virgin queens by providing
the `crossPlanQueens` to the `cross()` functions.

```{r}
# Cross a single virgin queen
virginQueen2 <- cross(virginQueen2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanQueens)
nFathers(virginQueen2)
# Cross multiple virgin queens
virginQueens2 <- cross(virginQueens2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanQueens)
nFathers(virginQueens2)
```

As already mentioned, we need to create a separate plan for crossing virgin
queens already in colonies, since here we need to provide colony IDs.

```{r}
(crossPlanColonies <- createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = c(getId(colony2), getId(apiary2)),
                                           drones = DCA,
                                           nDrones = nFathersPoisson))
```

We again see that the cross plan is a list now with colony IDs and elements of
the list being the ID of drones the virgin queen within each colony will mate
with. Now, we can cross our "colonies" by providing the `crossPlanColonies` to
the `cross()` function.

```{r}
# Cross a single colony
colony2 <- cross(colony2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanColonies)
nFathers(colony2)
# Cross an apiary
apiary2 <- cross(x = apiary2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanColonies)
nFathers(apiary2)
```

# Cross virgin queens on a mating station

Mating virgin queens on a mating station is no different than mating them in an
open DCA - the difference is in the DCA itself. In the case of open mating, the
DCA consists of drones from multiple queens, all of which are usually unknown.
In the case of a mating station, the DCA consists of drones all coming from a
sister group of drone producing queens (DPQ), the queen of which is also known.
This allows us to track the pedigree on the paternal side.

First, you need to create a mating station DCA. For this, we have created a
function `createMatingStationDCA()` that takes a single sire colony (queen of
the DPQs). From the sire colony, the function first produce a desired number of
sister DPQs, and next produces a desired number of drones per DPQ. The produced
drones represent the mating station's DCA.

```{r}
# Create a DCA at a mating station from colony1
(matingStationDCA <- createMatingStationDCA(colony1, nDPQs = 20, nDronePerDPQ = 1000))
```

We see that the output of the function is a single population of 20,000 drones
that represents the DCA. Once you have the DCA, you can cross virgin queens
either by pulling out populations of drones or creating a mating plan as already
described.

Here, we will mate a single colony (`colony3`) and a group of colonies
(`apiary3`) on a mating station according to a cross plan.

```{r}
# Mate only an apiary
crossPlanMatingStation <- createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = c(getId(colony3), 
                                                         getId(apiary3)),
                                                drones = matingStationDCA,
                                                nDrones = nFathersTruncPoisson)

# Cross a colony
colony3 <- cross(colony3, crossPlan = crossPlanMatingStation, drones = matingStationDCA)
nFathers(colony3)
# Cross an apiary
apiary3 <- cross(apiary3, crossPlan = crossPlanMatingStation, drones = matingStationDCA)
nFathers(apiary3)
```

# Cross virgin queens with different methods

It could happen that you have e.g. 10 virgin colonies in an apiary - you would
want to inseminate one of the virgin queens artificially with a single drone,
take three of them on a mating station, and mate the rest of them openly on a
local DCA. Since the cross plan is a named list, you can concatenate multiple
cross plans into one. Let's mate the multicolony `apiary4` in such a manner.

```{r}
# Create a single drone for single drone insemination
singleDrone = createDrones(colony2, nInd = 1)
# Create a cross plan for crossing some of the colonies in an open DCA, 
# some with single drone, and some on a mating station
crossPlanApiary4 <- c(
  createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = getId(apiary4)[1], 
                        drones = singleDrone, 
                        nDrones = 1),
  createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = getId(apiary4)[2:6], 
                        drones = DCA, 
                        nDrones = nFathersTruncPoisson),
  createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = getId(apiary4)[7:10], 
                        drones = matingStationDCA, 
                        nDrones = nFathersTruncPoisson)
  )

apiary4 <- cross(apiary4, 
                 crossPlan = crossPlanApiary4, 
                 drones = c(singleDrone, DCA, matingStationDCA))
nFathers(apiary4)
```
