\item{nWorkers}{numeric or function, number of worker to add to the colony,
but see \code{new}; if \code{NULL} then \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{SimParamBee}$nWorkers}
is used. If input is \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{MultiColony-class}},
the input could also be a vector of the same length as the number of colonies. If
a single value is provided, the same value will be applied to all the colonies.}

\item{nDrones}{numeric or function, number of drones to add to the colony,
but see \code{new}; if \code{NULL} then \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{SimParamBee}$nDrones}
is used. If input is \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{MultiColony-class}},
the input could also be a vector of the same length as the number of colonies. If
a single value is provided, the same value will be applied to all the colonies.}

\item{new}{logical, should the number of workers and drones be added anew or
should we only top-up the existing number of workers and drones to
\code{nWorkers} and \code{nDrones} (see details)}

\item{exact}{logical, if the csd locus is turned on and exact is \code{TRUE},
create the exact specified number of only viable workers (heterozygous on
the csd locus)}

\item{resetEvents}{logical, call \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{resetEvents}} as part of the
build up}

\item{simParamBee}{\code{\link[SIMplyBee]{SimParamBee}}, global simulation parameters}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{nWorkers} or \code{nDrones}
when these arguments are a function}

\description{
Level 2 function that builds up a Colony or MultiColony object by adding
  (raising) workers and drones usually in spring or after events such as split or
  swarming.
}
\details{
This function increases queen's \code{nWorkers}, \code{nHomBrood},
  and \code{nDrones} counters. It also turns production on.

  Argument \code{new} enables simulation of two common cases. First,
  if you are modelling year-to-year cycle, you will likely want
  \code{new = TRUE}, so that, say, in spring you will replace old (from last
  year) workers and drones with the new ones. This is the case that we are
  targeting and hence \code{new = TRUE} is default. Second, if you are
  modelling shorter period cycles, you will likely want \code{new = FALSE} to
  just top up the current workers and drones - you might also want to look at
  \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{replaceWorkers}} and \code{\link[SIMplyBee]{replaceDrones}}.

TODO: Discuss on how to model day-to-day variation with \code{new = FALSE}.
      We are not sure this is easy to achieve with current implementation
      just now, but could be expanded.
