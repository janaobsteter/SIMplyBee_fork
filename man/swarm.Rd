\usage{
swarm(
  x,
  p = NULL,
  year = NULL,
  nVirginQueens = NULL,
  sampleLocation = TRUE,
  sdLocation = NULL,
  simParamBee = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{Colony-class}} or \code{\link{MultiColony-class}}}

\item{p}{numeric, proportion of workers that will leave with the swarm colony;
if \code{NULL} then \code{\link{SimParamBee}$swarmP} is used.
If input is \code{\link{MultiColony-class}},
the input could also be a vector of the same length as the number of colonies. If
a single value is provided, the same value will be applied to all the colonies}

\item{year}{numeric, year of birth for virgin queens}

\item{nVirginQueens}{integer, the number of virgin queens to be created in the
colony; of these one is randomly selected as the new virgin queen of the
remnant colony. If \code{NULL}, the value from \code{simParamBee$nVirginQueens}
is used}

\item{sampleLocation}{logical, sample location of the swarm by taking
the current colony location and adding deviates from normal distribution to
each coordinate}

\item{sdLocation}{numeric, two standard deviations to sample new location -
one for each coordinate (see \code{sampleLocation}); if \code{NULL} then
\code{\link{SimParamBee}$swarmSDLocation} is used (which uses \code{c(0, 0)},
so by default swarm does not fly far away)}

\item{simParamBee}{\code{\link{SimParamBee}}, global simulation parameters}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{p} or \code{nVirginQueens}
when these arguments are functions}
}
\value{
list with two \code{\link{Colony-class}} or \code{\link{MultiColony-class}},
  the \code{swarm} and the \code{remnant} (see the description what each
  colony holds!); both outputs have the swarm event set to \code{TRUE}
}
\description{
Level 2 function that swarms a Colony or MultiColony object -
  an event where the queen
  leaves with a proportion of workers to create a new colony (the swarm). The
  remnant colony retains the other proportion of workers and all drones, and
  the workers raise virgin queens, of which only one prevails. Location of
  the swarm is the same as for the remnant or sampled as deviation from the
  remnant.
