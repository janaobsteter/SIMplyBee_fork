\usage{
createCrossPlan(
  x,
  drones = NULL,
  droneColonies = NULL,
  nDrones = NULL,
  spatial = FALSE,
  radius,
  simParamBee = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{Pop-class}} or code{\link{Colony-class}} or \code{\link{MultiColony-class}},
the object with the virgin queens that need to be crossed. When \code{spatial = TRUE},
the argument needs to be a code{\link{Colony-class}} or \code{\link{MultiColony-class}}
with the location set}

\item{drones}{\code{\link{Pop-class}}, a population of drones (resembling a drone
congregation area) available for mating. When \code{spatial = TRUE}, the user can not
provide drones, but needs to provide drone producing colonies instead
(see argument \code{droneColonies})}

\item{droneColonies}{\code{\link{MultiColony-class}}, drone producing colonies
available for mating. When \code{spatial = TRUE},
the object needs to have the location set}

\item{nDrones, }{integer or function, number of drones to sample for each crossing. You need to provide
this to provide this argument even when sampling drone producing colonies (otherwise, the default value
will be used)}

\item{spatial}{logical, whether the drone producing colonies should be sampled according
to their distance from the virgin colony (that is, in a radius)}

\item{radius}{numeric, the radius from the virgin colony in which to sample mating partners,
only needed when \code{spatial = TRUE}}

\item{simParamBee}{\code{\link{SimParamBee}}, global simulation parameters}
}
\value{
named list with names being virgin queens/colonies IDs with each
  list element holding the IDs of selected drones or drone producing colonies
}
\description{
Level 0 function that creates a plan for crossing virgin queens or
  virgin colonies by sampling drones or drone producing colonies to mate with a the
  virgin queens/colonies either at random (\code{spatial = FALSE})
  or according to the distance between colonies (\code{spatial = TRUE}).
