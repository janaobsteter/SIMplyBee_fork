  managed split}
\usage{
splitPUnif(colony, n = 1, min = 0.2, max = 0.4)

splitPColonyStrength(colony, n = 1, nWorkersFull = 100, scale = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{colony}{\code{\link{Colony-class}}}

\item{n}{integer, number of samples}

\item{min}{numeric, lower limit for \code{splitPUnif}}

\item{max}{numeric, upper limit for \code{splitPUnif}}

\item{nWorkersFull}{numeric, average number of workers in a full/strong
colony for \code{splitPColonyStrength} (actual number can go beyond this
value)}

\item{scale}{numeric, scaling of numbers in \code{splitPColonyStrength}
to avoid to narrow range when colonies have a large number of bees (in that
case change \code{nWorkersFull} too!)}
}
\value{
numeric, split proportion
}
\description{
Sample the split proportion - proportion of removed workers in a
  managed split - used when \code{p = NULL} - (see
  \code{\link{SimParamBee}$splitP}).

  This is just an example. You can provide your own functions that satisfy
  your needs!
}
\details{
\code{splitPUnif} samples from a uniform distribution between values
  0.2 and 0.4 irrespective of colony strength.

  \code{splitPColonyStrength} samples from a beta distribution with mean
  \code{a / (a + b)}, where \code{a = nWorkers + nWorkersFull} and \code{b =
  nWorkers}. This beta sampling mimics larger splits for strong colonies and
  smaller splits for weak colonies - see examples. This is just an example -
  adapt to your needs!

  The \code{nWorkersFull} default value used in this function is geared
  towards a situation where we simulate ~100 workers per colony (down-scaled
  simulation for efficiency). If you simulate more workers, you should change
  the default accordingly.
