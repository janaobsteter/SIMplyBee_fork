\title{Calculate Genomic Relatedness Matrix (GRM) for honeybees from
  Identical By Descent genomic data}
\usage{
calcBeeGRMIbd(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{matrix}} of haplotypes/genomes with allele indicators
for the founders coded as 1, 2, ... Haplotypes/genome are in rows and sites
are in columns; no missing values are allowed (this is not checked!). Row
names are essential (formated as ind_genome as returned by AlphaSimR IBD
functions) to infer the individual and their ploidy (see examples)!}
}
\value{
a list with a matrix of gametic relatedness coefficients (genome) and
  a matrix of individual relatedness coefficients (indiv)
}
\description{
Level 0 function that returns Genomic Relatedness Matrix (GRM)
  for honeybees from Identical By Descent genomic data (tracked alleles
  since the founders) - see references on the background theory.
