\item{nWorkers}{numeric or function, number of worker; if \code{NULL} then
\code{simParamBee$nWorkers} is used (unless \code{new = TRUE}, currently
present workers are taken into account and only the missing difference is
added)}

\code{simParamBee$nDrones} is used (unless \code{new = TRUE}, currently
present drones are taken into account so only the missing difference is
added)}

\item{new}{logical, should the workers and drones be added a fresh (ignoring
currently present workers and drones)}

\item{exact}{logical, if the csd locus is turned on and exact is TRUE,
create the exact specified number of only
viable workers (heterozygous on the csd locus)}

\item{resetEvents}{logical, call \code{\link{resetEvents}} as part of the
build up}

Level 3 function that does the same as
