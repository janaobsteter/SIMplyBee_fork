# Introduction

This vignette shows how you can cross virgin queens in SIMplyBee. Here, we present, how you can cross:
* single or multiple virgin queens (class `Pop`), virgin queen in a colony (class `Colony`), or all the virgin queens in an apiary or population (class `MultiColony`);
* cross either with pre-selected population/group of drones or according to a cross plan.
* cross queens on an open DCA or mating station

First, we have to create a founder population and some virgin queen, virgin colonies, and virgin apiaries
that we will later cross.
```{r}
# Simulate 40 founder genomes
founderGenomes <- quickHaplo(nInd = 50, nChr = 1, segSites = 100)
# Set global population paramaters
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)
# Create a base population of 40 virgin queens
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)

# Prepare virgin queens, colonies and apiaries for crossing
virginQueen1 <- basePop[1]
virginQueen2 <- basePop[2]
virginQueen3 <- basePop[3]
virginQueens1 <- basePop[4:6]
virginQueens2 <- basePop[7:9]
virginQueens3 <- basePop[10:12]
colony1 <- createColony(basePop[13])
colony2 <- createColony(basePop[14])
colony3 <- createColony(basePop[15])
colony4 <- createColony(basePop[16])
apiary1 <- createMultiColony(basePop[17:21])
apiary2 <- createMultiColony(basePop[22:26])
apiary3 <- createMultiColony(basePop[27:31])
apiary4 <- createMultiColony(basePop[32:41])
```

We will now create a groups of droned from the remaining queens, that will represent a drone congregation area (DCA).
```{r}
# Create a DCA from the remaining virgin queens
DCA <- createDrones(basePop[42:50], nInd = 1000)
```

# Cross virgin queens on an open DCA
## Cross by pre-selecting drone populations
We will start by crossing our populations and colonies to a pre-selected populations of drones. We pre-select the groups by pulling a desired number of drone packages from a DCA with the function `pullDroneGroupsFromDCA()`. To this function we need to provide a groups of drones (`DCA`), how many groups you want to pull from the DCA (`n`), and how many drones per group do you want (`nDrones`). For `nDrones`, you can either specify an integer or a sampling function, which results in a different number of drones in each of the pulled groups. We provide some suggestions of the sampling functions:
* nFathersPoisson: samples the number of drones from a Poisson distribution with a default mean of 15 (the user can specif a different mean)
* nFathersTruncatedPoisson: samples the number of drones from a Poisson distribution with a default mean of 15 (the user can specif a different mean)
* you can specify your own sampling function.

We can pull the drone groups out separately for each crossing or pull them out all at once.
```{r}
# Pre-select drone (father) populations from a DCA
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(DCA, n = 20, nDrones = nFathersTruncPoisson)
```


Now, we can cross our virgin queens with drone packages.
```{r}
# A single virgin queen
virginQueen1 <- cross(virginQueen1, drones = droneGroups[[1]])
nFathers(virginQueen1)
# Multiple virgin queens
virginQueens1 <- cross(virginQueens1, drones = droneGroups[2:4])
nFathers(virginQueens1)
# A colony
colony1 <- cross(colony1, drones = droneGroups[[5]])
nFathers(colony1)
# An apiary
apiary1 <- cross(x = apiary1, drones = droneGroups[6:10])
nFathers(apiary1)
```

## Cross by preparing a cross plan
Providing packages / populations of drones can be memory consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of colonies. An alternative is to provide a cross plan with IDs of the virgin queens or colonies and drones, and a single drone population with all the drones listed in the cross plan. You can create a cross plan with the function `createRandomCrossPlan()`. This function creates a cross plan by randomly sampling a desired number of drones from a DCA and assigning them to either virgin queen ID or colony ID. When crossing a virgin queen in a colony, you have to provide the colony ID, since there could be multiple virgin queens within the colony and the random selection of one happens only within the `cross()` function. To create a cross plan you therefore have to provide the IDs of either the virgin queens or the colonies you want to cross (but not both in the same cross plan!!!), the drone population, and the number of drones you want to mate a particular virgin queen with. This can again be a fixed number or a sampling function. We can create a separate cross plan for each mating or create one combined cross plan for multiple matings (but can not have virgin queen's and colonies's ID in the cross plan at the same time!!!). Here, we again mate a single virgin queen, a population of virgin queens, a colony, and an apiary.
```{r}
# Create a combined cross for matingn a single queen (virginQueen2) and a population
# of virgin queen (virginQueens2)
crossPlanQueens <- createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = c(getId(virginQueen2),
                                                 getId(virginQueens2)),
                                         drones = DCA,
                                         nFathers = 15)
# Cross a aingle virgin queen
virginQueen2 <- cross(virginQueen2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanQueens)
nFathers(virginQueen2)
# Cross multiple virgin queens
virginQueens2 <- cross(virginQueens2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanQueens)
nFathers(virginQueens2)

crossPlanColonies <- createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = c(getId(colony2), getId(apiary2)),
                                           drones = DCA,
                                           nFathers = nFathersPoisson)
# Cross a single colony
colony2 <- cross(colony2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanColonies)
nFathers(colony2)
# Cross an apiary
apiary2 <- cross(x = apiary2, drones = DCA, crossPlan = crossPlanColonies)
nFathers(apiary2)
```

# Cross virgin queens on a mating station
Mating virgin queens on a mating station is no different than mating them in an open DCA - the different in the DCA itself. In the case of open mating, the DCA consists of drones from multiple queens, all of which are usually unknown. In the case of a mating station, the DCA consists of drones all coming from a sister group of drone producing queens (DPQ), the queen of which is also known. This allows us to track the pedigree also on the paternal side.

First, you need to create a mating station DCA. For this, we have created a function `createMatingStationDCA()`, that takes a single sire colony (queen of the DPQs). From the sire colony, we first produce a desired number of sister DPQs, and next produce a desired number of drones per DPQ. The produced drones represent the mating station's DCA.
```{r}
# Create a DCA at a mating station from colony1
matingStationDCA <- createMatingStationDCA(colony1, nDPQs = 20, nDronePerDPQ = 1000)
```

Here, we will mate a single colony and a group of colonies (`Multicolony` object `apiary3`) on a mating station. We will again start by preparing a combined mating with colony IDs, according to which we will mate our queens.
```{r}
# Mate only an apiary
crossPlanMatingStation <- createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = c(getId(colony3), 
                                                         getId(apiary3)),
                                                drones = matingStationDCA,
                                                nFathers = nFathersTruncPoisson)

# Cross a colony
colony3 <- cross(colony3, crossPlan = crossPlanMatingStation, drones = matingStationDCA)
nFathers(colony3)
# Cross an apiary
apiary3 <- cross(apiary3, crossPlan = crossPlanMatingStation, drones = matingStationDCA)
nFathers(apiary3)
```

# Cross virgin queens with different methods
It could happen, that you have e.g. 10 virgin colonies in an apiary - you would want to inseminate one of the virgin queens artificially with a single drone, take three of them on a mating station, and mate the rest of them openly on a local DCA. Since cross plan is a named list, you can concatenate multiple cross plans into one. Let's mate the multicolony `apiary4` in such a manner.
```{r}
# Create a single drone for single drone insemination
singleDrone = createDrones(colony2, nInd = 1)
# Create a cross plan for crossinge some of the colonies in an open DCA, some with single drone, and some on a mating station
crossPlanApiary4 <- c(
  createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = getId(apiary4)[1], drones = singleDrone, nFathers = 1),
  createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = getId(apiary4)[2:6], drones = DCA, nFathers = nFathersTruncPoisson),
  createRandomCrossPlan(IDs = getId(apiary4)[7:10], drones = matingStationDCA, nFathers = nFathersTruncPoisson)
  )

apiary4 <- cross(apiary4, crossPlan = crossPlanApiary4, drones = c(singleDrone, DCA, matingStationDCA))
nFathers(apiary4)
```
