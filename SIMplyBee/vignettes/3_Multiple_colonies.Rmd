# Introduction
We have already introduced the Colony class that holds colony-specific information and caste individuals. However, when working with honeybees, we usually do not work with a single colony, but with apiaries or even whole populations instead. To cater for this, we created a `MultiColony` class. It behaves as a list of `Colony` objects but with additional functionality - you can apply function directly to the `MultiColony` objects. A `MultiColony` can represent different apiaries or even different subpopulations in terms of either age of the queens of geographical location of the apiaries. 

# Creating a MultiColony object
We create a `MultiColony` object with `createMultiColony()` function. Let's say you want to create a `MultiColony` object that represents a single apiary. The first option is to initialise an empty `MultiColony` object that represents an empty apiary without any colonies and individuals within.
```{r}
# Create an empty apiary
emptyApiary <- createMultiColony()
emptyApiary
```
The second option is again to create an empty `MultiColony` object that represents an empty apiary without any individuals within, but with a defined number of colony slots.
```{r}
# Create an empty apiary with 10 colony slots
emptyApiary1 <- createMultiColony(n = 10)
emptyApiary1
```
The third option is to create a `MultiColony` object with a population of either virgin or mated queens. For this, we first have to initialise the simulation by simulating founder genomes and creating a base population of virgin queens. We will use 10 virgin queens to produce drones and create a DCA.

```{r}
# Create 20 founder genomes
founderGenomes <- quickHaplo(nInd = 20, nChr = 1, segSites = 100)
# Set up new global simulation parameters
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes)
# Create a base population of 20 virgin queens
basePop <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)
# Create a DCA from the drones of the first 10 queens
DCA <- createDrones(basePop[1:10], nInd = 100)
```

We will now create an apiary with 10 virgin colonies with the `createMultiColony()` function by providing the remaining 10 virgin queens as the input parameter. Let's say this apiary stands at the location 1 (1,1) and call it `apiary1`.
```{r}
# Create an apiary with the remaining virgin queens
apiary1 <- createMultiColony(x = basePop[11:20])
# Set the location of the apiary
apiary1 <- setLocation(apiary1, c(1,1))
# Check whether all the colonies are virgin
isQueenPresent(apiary1)
isVirginQueensPresent(apiary1)
```
Once we have a non-empty `MultiColony` object, we can do some basic operations on it. First, we can select some of colonies by either specifying the IDs, desired number or percentage of randomly selected colonies.
```{r}
# Get the IDs of the colonies
getId(apiary1)
# Select colonies according to IDs
selectColonies(apiary1, ID = c(1,2))
# Randomly select a given percentage of colonies
selectColonies(apiary1, p = 0.1)
```

Second, we can pull some colonies from the `MultiColony` object. This means, that the pulled colonies are pulled-out and removed from the original object. The function `pullColonies()` therefore returns two object - the pulled colonies and the remnant colonies.
```{r}
# Pull one colony - returns $remnant and $pulled object
pullColonies(apiary1, n = 1)
```

Third, we can also remove some colonies from the `MultiColony` object with `removeColonies()` function.
```{r}
removeColonies(apiary1, ID = 3)
```

Next, we will cross all the virgin queens in the apiary with the `cross()` function to groups of drones that we collected from the DCA with the `pullDroneGroupsFromDCA()` function.
```{r}
# Pull 10 groups of drones from the DCA
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(DCA, n = 10, nFathers = nFathersPoisson)
# Cross all virgin queens in the apiary to the selected drones
apiary1 <- cross(apiary1, fathers = droneGroups)
# Check whether the queens are present (and gence mated)
isQueenPresent(apiary1)
```


Once we have mated queens in the apiary, we can apply all the events functions directly to the `MultiColony` object: `buildUp()`, `downsize()`, `swarm()`, `split()`, `supersede()`, `collapse()` but also all the functions that either add, replace, or remove individuals from the castes. Let's say we know want to build up all the colonies in our apiary.
```{r}
# Initiate an empty apiary2 at the location (2,2)
apiary2 <- createMultiColony()
apiary2 <- setLocation(apiary2, c(2,2))
# Build-up all the colonies in the apiary1
apiary1 <- buildUp(apiary1, nWorkers = 1000, nDrones = 100)
```

Now, let's split all the colonies in the `apiary1` and swarm 10% of the colonies. Splitting and swarming all duplicate the number of colonies and set up a new virgin queen in the remaining colonies. Let's say we want to put all the these newly created virgin colonies to a new location (2,2) in `apiary2.`
```{r}
# Split all the colonies in the apiary1 - this returns two lists of colonies
tmp <- split(apiary1)
tmp
# Assign the remnants with the old queens back to the apiary1
apiary1 <- tmp$remnants
# Assign the splits to a new apiary2
apiary2 <- c(apiary2, tmp$splits)
# Pull out 10% colonies that will swarm
tmp <- pullColonies(apiary1, p = 0.1)
# Keep the remnants in the apiary1
apiary1 <- tmp$remnant
# Swarm the pulled-out colonies
tmp <- swarm(tmp$pulled, p = 0.5)
# Let's assume you loose the swarms
# Put the remnants in the new apiary2
apiary2 <- c(apiary2, tmp$remnants)
```

Here, we defined different `MultiColony` objects according to the location of the apiary. The objects could also be defined according to the age of the queens - `age0`, `age1`... Here, `apiary2` are actually all new virgin queens of age 0 produced through splitting and swarming.

Let's say we now want to mate the `apiary2` that contains only virgin queens. We want to mate them to a DCA made of drones in `apiary1`. Since some time has passed, we want to first replace the drones in `apiary1` with new drones. We can do that with `replaceDrones()` function.
```{r}
apiary1 <- replaceDrones(apiary1)
```
Now that we have a new set of drones, we can create a DCA with the function `createDCA()` and mate virgin queens in apiary2 to the DCA.
```{r}
# Check whether all colonies in apiary2 are virgin
isQueenPresent(apiary2)
isVirginQueensPresent(apiary2)
# Create a DCA from all the drones in apiary
DCA <- createDCA(apiary1)
# Check how big is the DCA
DCA
# Sample drones groups from the DCA
droneGroups <- pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(DCA, n = nColonies(apiary2), nFathers = nFathersPoisson)
# Cross virgin queens in apiary2 to selected drones
apiary2 <- cross(apiary2, fathers = droneGroups)
```
