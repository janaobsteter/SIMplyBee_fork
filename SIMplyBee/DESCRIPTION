Description: SIMplyBee is an extension of the AlphaSimR package
  (https://cran.r-project.org/package=AlphaSimR) for stochastic simulations of
  honeybee populations and breeding programmes. It enables simulation of
  individual bees that form a colony, which includes a queen, fathers (drones
  the queen mated with), virgin queens, workers, and drones. Multiple colony can
  be merged into a population of colonies, such as an apiary or a whole country
  of colonies. Functions enable operations on castes, colony, or colonies, to
  ease R scripting of whole populations. All AlphaSimR functionality with
  respect to genomes and genetic and phenotype values is available and further
  extended for honeybees, including haplo-diploidy, csd locus, colony events
  (swarming, supersedure, etc.), and colony phenotype values.
