# SIMplyBee version 0.4.1

-   2024-09-19

## Bug fixes

-   locations of the colonies in the D_Crossing vignettes were previously
sampled by random. This caused that on some runs some queens were left unmated,
which caused an error. We now read in the locations from a csv file.


# SIMplyBee version 0.4.0

-   2024-08-23

## Major changes

-   createColony() and createMultiColony() do not have the location
    argument anymore; use setLocation() instead; by default, location is
    now c(0, 0) PR#500


## New features ##
-   In setLocation(MultiColony) we can set one location (numeric) or
    multiple (list or data.frame) PR#500
-   getLocation(MultiColony) got the collapse argument
    Commit#f4e629c3e8920948ad576eae3615a86b26300790

-   We can now sample location of a swarm - see sampleLocation and
    radius arguments in swarm() PR#500 PR#502

-   New function rcircle() to sample a random point within a circle with
    a given radius PR#502

-   Removed the function createRandomCrossPlan() - that option is now
    included in the newly added createCrossPlan() fuction

-   Added the **functionality for spatially-aware mating** of honeybee
    colonies. The new functionality is included in the
    createCrossPlan(), that allows to create the cross plan according to
    the colonies' locations, and in the cross() function, that crosses
    bees according to their location. This did not break the old
    functionality of the cross function.
    
-  Unified setMisc and getMisc behaviour to comply with the new AlphaSimR behaviour

-  Added new C++ function isHeterozygous() to speed up the SIMplyBee function isCsdHeterozygous() 

## Bug fixes

-   Bug fix - get\*Haplo() functions were returning diploid drones when
    input was a Pop-class
